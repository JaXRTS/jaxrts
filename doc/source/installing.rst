Installation
============

The easiest way to include this project into your workflow is to
``pip install`` the newest ``.whl`` file, that can be found on the
`release
page <https://gitea.hed.physik.uni-rostock.de/lue/jaxrts/releases>`__.

New releases are automatically built when a new git tag is generated
