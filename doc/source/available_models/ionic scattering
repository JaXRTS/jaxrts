The ionic (elastic) scattering component, :math:`S_{ee}^{\text{el}}(k, \omega)`, represents the coherent scattering of photons from electrons that are tightly bound to ions and follow their motion, and from the screening cloud. This term reflects the static ionâ€“ion correlations in the system and typically gives rise to a sharp elastic peak centered at :math:`\omega = 0`.
