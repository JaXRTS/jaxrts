The free–free scattering component, :math:`S_{ee}^{\text{ff}}(k, \omega)`, describes inelastic scattering from unbound (free) electrons. In the **RPA** (Random Phase Approximation), electrons are treated as a weakly coupled gas with collective screening effects, while the **Born–Mermin** approach extends this by including electron–ion collisions and finite damping, providing a more accurate description in partially or strongly coupled plasmas.
