When calculating the the Born collision frequencies in :py:class:`jaxrts.models.BornMermin` and derived free-free scattering models, one needs a notion of the static ionic structure factor. For a single species, :py:class:`jaxrts.models.Sum_Sii` is identical to the model used for the ``ionic scattering`` key. However, it is not clear if the sum calculated there also holds true for a multi-species plasma, where we would run an HNC calculation, which cannot be directly used. In this case, :py:class:`jaxrts.models.AverageAtom_Sii` might be a reasonable alternative, as it calculates S_ii in an HNC step for an average atom.
