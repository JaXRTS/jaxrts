The freeâ€“bound scattering component, :math:`S_{ee}^{\text{fb}}(k, \omega)`, represents inelastic scattering events in which a free electron recombines into a bound state, emitting a photon. In thermodynamic equilibrium and for :math:`k \ll k_0`, its spectral shape is directly related to the bound free component, :math:`S_{ee}^{\text{bf}}(k, \omega)`, through the principle of detailed balance :cite:`Bohme.2023`.
