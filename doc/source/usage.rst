Usage
=====

In this section we (very briefly) introduce XRTS and the key concepts of
jaxrts. We provide a guide on how to set up a first simulation. This can be the
starting point for your only computations, as models can be easily swapped and
:py:class:`jaxrts.plasmastate.PlasmaState` and :py:class:`jaxrts.setup.Setup`
objects extended and modified.

For a full list of models currently implemented, see :doc:`models`.

From there on, we provide a extensive list of example uses in the next section
(:doc:`gen_examples/index`).
