Generating a first spectrum
===========================

This page introduces the design of ``jaxrts``, and guides you through the
process of generating a first spectrum.
Note that the full script is available in the example section of this
documentation, under :doc:`gen_examples/plot_getting_started`.


jaxrts provides three main types:

* :py:class:`jaxrts.PlasmaState` contains information about the plasma. It
  defines, e.g., the constituents of the plasma (in form of
  :py:class:`jaxrts.Element`s), electron- and ion temperature, density, and
  ionization.
* :py:class:`jaxrts.Setup`, on the other hand, defines the geometry of the
  experiment, like probing energy, scattering angle, and source-instrument
  function.
* :py:class:`jaxrts.models.Model` contain approximations for a given plasma
  state. A model should at least contain a
  :py:meth:`jaxrts.models.Model.evaluate`, which takes a ``PlasmaState`` and a
  ``Setup`` as argument, and computes the relevant quantities.

First, import the relevant packages:

.. code:: python

    from functools import partial
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from jax import numpy as jnp
    import jaxrts

    # We use the jpu package (which is enabling the usage of pint with jax) to
    # handle units.
    ureg = jaxrts.ureg

Here, please note two important features: We import :py:mod:`jax.numpy`, in
favor of :py:mod:`numpy`. This is crucial, as it enables us to use jax' just in
time compilation.
For most cases, you can just use it as a drop-in replacement without any
errors. However, some problems might arise, especially when changing individual
entries of an array in-place. We highly recommend reading the `documentation of
jax on protential pitfalls
<https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/notebooks/Common_Gotchas_in_JAX.html>`_.

Secondly, we utilize units, throughout. This is achieved with the ``ureg``
instance; its application should be clear after reading this example.
We rely on `jpu <https://github.com/dfm/jpu>`_, a port of `pint
<https://pint.readthedocs.io>`_ to the jax ecosystem.

With this out of the way, we lets the define a two-times ionized Beryllium
plasma at :math:`\rho=1\text{g/cc}`, an electron temperature :math:`k_BT_e =
1\text{eV}`.

If no ion temperature is given explicitly, we assume equilibrium of ion and
electron temperatures as a default.

.. code:: python

    state = jaxrts.PlasmaState(
        ions=[jaxrts.Element("Be")],
        Z_free=jnp.array([2]),
        mass_density=jnp.array([1]) * ureg.gram / ureg.centimeter**3,
        T_e=2 * ureg.electron_volt / ureg.k_B,  # T_e is the electron temperature.
    )

Now, we also have to define a :py:class:`jaxrts.Setup`. :py:mod:`jpu` and also
allows to convert string to quantities with units, as you can see below.

.. code:: python

    setup = jaxrts.Setup(
        scattering_angle=ureg("60Â°"),
        energy=ureg("4700 eV"),
        measured_energy=ureg("4700 eV")
        + jnp.linspace(-100, 40, 500) * ureg.electron_volt,
        instrument=partial(
            jaxrts.instrument_function.instrument_gaussian,
            sigma=ureg("5.0eV") / ureg.hbar / (2 * jnp.sqrt(2 * jnp.log(2))),
        ),
    )


To attach a :py:class:`jaxrts.models.Model` instance to the
:py:class:`jaxrts.PlasmaState`, just assign the instance to the appropriate
key. The four keys you see below are mandatory to be set. However, depending on
the models implemented, you might want have to specify different additional
models, e.g., ``ipd``. See :doc:`models` for a comprehensive list of models
available in jaxrts.

.. code:: python

    state["ionic scattering"] = jaxrts.models.OnePotentialHNCIonFeat()
    state["free-free scattering"] = jaxrts.models.RPA_DandreaFit()
    state["bound-free scattering"] = jaxrts.models.SchumacherImpulse()
    state["free-bound scattering"] = jaxrts.models.DetailedBalance()

Finally, we call :py:meth:`jaxrts.PlasmaState.probe`, to evaluate the
scattering on the defined plasma state with the geometry defined.

.. code:: python

    # Generate the spectrum
    See_tot = state.probe(setup)

    # Plot the result
    plt.plot(
        setup.measured_energy.m_as(ureg.electron_volt),
        See_tot.m_as(ureg.second),
    )
    plt.xlabel("Probed Energy [eV]")
    plt.ylabel("$S_{ee}^{tot}$ [s]")
    plt.title("Be plasma at 2eV and 1g/cc with Z=2")
    plt.show()

Above code produces the following plot:

Since we did not set :py:attr:`jaxrts.Setup.frc_exponent`, above, it defaults
to zero, i.e., the output of jaxrts is proportional to the dynamic structure
factor, convolved with the source instrument function.

example showing the effect of this correction.
