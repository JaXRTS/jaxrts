  abstract = {<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>We have performed HNC calculations for dense beryllium plasma as studied experimentally using x‐ray Thomson scattering, recently. We treated non‐equilibrium situations with different electron and ion temperatures which are relevant in pump‐probe experiments on ultra‐short time scales. To consider quantum effects adequately, we used effective pair potentials to describe the interactions. Results are compared with classical as well as quantum corrected Debye model calculations.
